**FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**
Members: Chris Lam

My project will be further implementing the Northstar Café from Assignments 2–3 by creating a full-stack website application—a platform where customers can browse the menu items, place drink orders, and view the cafe's story and branding. This will act as a digital tool for the home cafe business but also an extension of the user experience: cozy, friendly, and mordern. The application will feature both public-facing and staff-only components, including order management tools and Chart.js analytics for the business. I want it to be where as if the customer is still using the website as if they are walking into the cafe itself.

The technologies used for this project will include Next.js (A react framework), Vercel (deployment), RadixUI (base UI), TailwindCSS (Responsive CSS), MongoDB (database), and Express (backend & cookies), and Chart.js (analytics). Tools will focus on server-side programming and will be done through JavaScript. This responsive and dynamic experience will reflect the simplicity and values of the cafe.
