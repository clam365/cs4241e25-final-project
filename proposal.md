Proposal (Due Friday, June 13, 11:59 pm)
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members, if any. The outline should have enough detail so that I can determine if it meets the minimum expectations or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. Please include a general description of the project and a list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript, etc.). Two to four paragraps should provide enough level of detail. Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request. Your pull request does not need to have a specific name. Only one pull request is required per team.

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project.

**FINAL PROJECT PROPOSA**
Members: Chris Lam

My project will be further implementing the Northstar Café from Assignments 2–3 by creating a full-stack website application—a platform where customers can browse the menu items, place drink orders, and view the cafe's story and branding. This will act as a digital tool for the home cafe business but also an extension of the user experience: cozy, friendly, and mordern. The application will feature both public-facing and staff-only components, including live order tracking, order management tools, email updates, and personalized user settings. I want it to be where as if the customer is still using the website as if they are walking into the cafe itself.

The technologies used for this project will include Next.js (A react framework), Vercel (deployment), Shadcn (base UI), TailwindCSS, MongoDB (database), and Express (backend). Tools will focus on server-side programming and will be done through JavaScript. This responsive and dynamic experience will reflect the simplicity and values of the cafe.
